        so this functionality is created in master branch
        then will add one more branch
        and will add some changes

so now, working under branch2
and will not add any changes other than this place
cause, seems like
conflict can be happen if under the same branch
I`ll make changes in different place
should check it

still continue to work here
that will checkout
and merge through VCS
